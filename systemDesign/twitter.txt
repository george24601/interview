MVP:  allow people follow each other and view others feeds

1. each person needs to have a list to follow
2. broadcasting change is too much, so we fetch on read, and add a timestamp on the last fetch date, retriveing dup is ok we will merge them in memory

so each one has (id, time) -> tweet tuple, to support quick bsearch


-------
extension 1: trending topics
Similar to the top 10 stream processing thing


extension 2: who to follow?
Recommendation engine:

extesion 3: search
Need to tokenize tweet, and full table scan => better on read copies since they will be slow!
