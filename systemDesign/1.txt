Design Live comments. If your facebook.com homepage is open with bunch of feeds and if someone comments on those feeds, the comments should automatically show up in facebook.com home page without refreshing the page. Feeds could be a simple status update by a friend, post in a group, post by a person you're following, post in a page you've liked etc. 

Few things what they are looking for - 
1. How do you solve it initially and how do you scale it? 
2. How do you scale push model in-case if you choose PUSH model to solve it? 
3. If push cannot scale how do you solve it? 
4. How pull model solves it? 
5. When will you use push vs pull?
