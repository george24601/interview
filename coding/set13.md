Problem A
-----------
Given 'n' circles (each defined by center and radius) 

Write an algorithm to detect if circles intersect with any other circle in the same plane 

Better than O(n^2) complexity

Problem B
---------
Implement Ring Buffer with read and write pointers. 
For example if the Ring buffer is implemented in the form of array of integers , one should be able to read / write more than one integer at a time. In short the data read / written should be in a chunk .


Problem C
---------
Given an int array without repeated elements and a target, count the total number of subset that can be generated from the array such that min (subset) + max (subset) < target 
public int countSubSet(int[] nums, int target){ 

}



Problem D
---------
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i. 

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times). However, you may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again). 
, but each time you sell you need to pay transaction fee, please calculate the maximum profit you can take. 

public int maxProfit(int[] prices, int fee) { 

}
