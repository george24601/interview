	Given an input file with four billion integers, provide an algorithm to generate an integer which is not contained in the file Assume you have 1 GB of memory
	FOLLOW UP
	What if you have only 10 MB of memory?


	------
You have an array with all the numbers from 1 to N, where N is at most 32,000 The array may have duplicate entries and you do not know what N is With only 4KB of memory available, how would you print all duplicate elements in the array?

How would you design the data structures for a very large social network (Facebook, LinkedIn, etc)? Describe how you would design an algorithm to show the connecction, or path, between two people (e g , Me -> Bob -> Susan -> Jason -> You)

This is a two-part question. 

Part one: Design one or more classes to represent the intersections and streets 
in a city. Streets can be either one-way or two-way. 

Part two: Using the classes from the previous question, determine whether there is a pair of intersections (A,B) such that there is exactly one route from A to B.

1) Finish writing the below method: bookReservation(Reservation reservation) 

2) You are free to add, modify, etc the following classes and method


import java.time.Duration;
import java.time.LocalTime;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;

// Your goal is to write business logic for a very simple Restaurant booking system
// You are encouraged to refactor exisiting code, create other classes, write helper methods etc
// You also need to make sure that the implementation works correctly


class Reservation
{
    public String name;
    public int partySize;
    public LocalTime startTime;
}

class Table
{
    public int tableNumber;
    public int maxPartySize;      
}

class Restaurant
{
    public List<Table> tables;   
    public LocalTime openTime;
    public LocalTime closeTime;
    public Map<Integer, Duration> reservationDurationsPerPartySize;
    
    // Returns a Table if Reservation could be booked, null otherwise
    // Booking rules: 
    // 1) Reservation could be made only when the Restaurant is open.
    // 2) Only one Reservation can be seatted a Table at any time.
    // 3) Reservation can be seatted only at a Table of the same or a bigger size.
    // 4) Reservation should stay on the same Table for the whole Duration.
    // 5) Reservation Duration is determined by PartySize.
    public Table bookReservation(Reservation reservation) {
          //fill this method
}

I need to create a database that have five columns each entry is such that there can be repeated tuples in each column(No primary key).There will be no two same entries 
There are 5 Methods that needs to be implemented 
1. Create() - create the database 
2. Add(string a,b,c,d,e) - Add single entries with 5 tuples(all strings) 
3. Update (culumntype1, columnvalue1,culumntype2, columnvalue2) 
- each entry having culumntype1 = columnvalue1 will be updated by columntype2=columnvalue2 and return total such eantries. 
4. Delete (culumntype1, columnvalue1) 
- each entry having culumntype1 = columnvalue1 will be deleted.and return total such eantries. 
5. Search(culumntype1, columnvalue1) 
- Search each entry having culumntype1 = columnvalue1 and return total such eantries. 

How to implement in best possible way such that there can be 50,000 such entries?

Considering a server that should ignore requests older than 1 second, create a structure to handle this behavior and give its complexity. 
Use any language you want.

Let's say you have 10,000 servers, each with a billion integers. How do you find the median?

Given a Binary tree (Not binary Search Tree ), find the inorder successor of a node.

inorder: left, mid, right

if current node has right child, then it will be left most leave of the right child
otherwise, it will be the first right child of its parent



class TreeNode{
    TreeNode left;
    TreeNode right;
     int val;
    public TreeNode(int val){
        this.val = val;
    }
}

public TreeNode inOrderSuccessor(TreeNode root, TreeNode n) {
}

Given a list of files. Return all the unique lines from all files.

How do you verify a search result list which changes consistently based on each search word and filters? 

For example, how do you make sure that the list is sorted based on price or rating or etc without any identical list to compare with? Since providing an identical list as Test Input for each word is not the best approach.

---------
Given a large file with sentences and query string, design a system (Class, data structs, functions, etc) and algorithm to return the smallest window (start and end offsets) in the input file where the query words (in any order) are seen in the text file. What is the time complexity?
