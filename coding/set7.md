Problem A
-----------
how to find leaf node value from preorder sequence of BST without rebuilding the tree


Problem B
-------
write a function that randomly return a random Fibonacci number in range [min, max) 
public int getRandom (int min, int max){}


Problem C
---------
Find the Lexicographic next word of the input word from a list of words 
Example 
Words list 
[Cat, dog, cow, donkey, zebra, monkey], 
input 
duck 
output 
monkey 

Input 
dog 
output 
donkey 
Can you use trie to solve it? 
public String findNextWord(List<String> words, String input){ 
}


Problem D
----------
Given a equation in the form of "3x+4y+2=-5y+2x+10", simplify the equation to be in form "y=Ax+B", and return A,B. Also allow parenthesis to be in the equation. Ex. "3y-4x+(3-(2x-3y))=10y", result is "y =0.75 - 1.5x"
