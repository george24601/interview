### Coding

* convert BST to a double linked list
* DAT vs trie?
* Use multi-thread to calc how many prime numbers betwenn 1 and 1 mil
* 3 threads to write into the same list 1,2,3, and you need to output 123123, the time is decided by the thread A
1. Write a livelock code example, i.e., dining philosopher problem
3. Design an implment a conneciton pool 
  * keep working q, idle q, and recycled q
  * Need to encapsulate the original connection
  * May need to create init connection
4. Implment a skip list,need to support insert, delete, find, and find_range
5. Implement a blocking queue with Java, e.g., include wait and notify
1. Write an example of mutilpe people racing on the same track. Leave at the same time and record used times
6. Design: use generics to implement LRU. 
  * Can LinkedHashMap, removeEldestEntry() if you are on java (What is DLL type in java?).
* similarly, count how many 1 bits in an integer? how about how many 0 bits in an integer? What if you can use limited storage?
