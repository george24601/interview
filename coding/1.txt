Inplace reverse a sentence 

You given a sentence of english words and spaces between them. 
Nothing crazy: 
1) no double spaces 
2) no empty words 
3) no spaces at the ends of a sentence


void inplace_reverse(char* arr, int length) {
    // your solution
}
Example: 
input "I wish you a merry Christmas" 
output "Christmas merry a you wish I"

Write a program to find pattern. 

0: 1 
1: 11 
2: 21 
3: 1211 
4: 111221 
5: 312211 

Iterate over the previous number, and find count for same number number. Append that count before number. 

e.g., 

public String pattern(int input){} 

If input = 4, function should return 111221.

Suppose we have array of N numbers. We will define N functions on this array. Each function will return the sum of all numbers in the array from Li to Ri ( Li is left index, Ri is right index). Now we have 2 types of queries: 

Type1: 1 x y Change the xth element of the array to y 
Type2: 2 l r Return the sum of all functions from m to n. 

Input type: 
First Line is the size of the array i.e. N 

Next Line contains N space separated numbers Ai denoting the array 

Next N line follows denoting Li and Ri for each functions. 

Next Line contains an integer Q , number of queries to follow. 

Next Q line follows , each line containing a query of Type 1 or Type 2 

Here is an example: 
Input: 
5 
1 2 3 4 5 
1 2 
3 4 
1 4 
1 5 
3 5 
5 
1 1 5 
2 2 4 
2 1 3 
1 4 5 
2 1 5 

Output: 
40 
28 
63 

Explanation: 
Function 1 is sum of values from index 1 to index 2 = 1+2=3 
So , F1=3 
Similarly, F2=3+4=7 
F3=1+2+3+4=10 
F4=15 
F5=12 

Now when I query 1 1 5 
means it is type 1 query, so we replace value at index 1 by 5. 
So our new array is, 
5 2 3 4 5 
and 
F1=7 
F2=7(unchanged) 
F3=14 
F4=19 
F5=12(unchanged) 

Then next query is 2 2 4 
means give sum of all functions from index 2 to 4. 
So, ans= 7+14+19 =40 (output 1) 

Similarly are other 2 outputs. 
Index are 1 based in example. 
Comment me if you are not clear with question. 

Edit: I know one can do it with naive approach or using segment tree. But they wanted more faster way to do it.

Given an array of positive integers that represents possible points a team could score in an individual play. Now there are two teams play against each other. Their final scores are S and S'. How would you compute the maximum number of times the team that leads could have changed? 
For example, if S=10 and S'=6. The lead could have changed 4 times: 
Team 1 scores 2, then Team 2 scores 3 (lead change); 
Team 1 scores 2 (lead change), Team 2 score 0 (no lead change); 
Team 1 scores 0, Team 2 scores 3 (lead change); 
Team 1 scores 3, Team 2 scores 0 (lead change); 
Team 1 scores 3, Team 2 scores 0 (no lead change).

Given a mapping of alphabets to integers as follows: 

1 = A 
2 = B 
3 = C 
... 
26 = Z 

Given any combination of the mapping numbers as string, return the number of ways in which the input string can be split into sub-strings and represented as character strings. For e.g. given 
"111" -> "AAA", "AK", "KA" -> 3 
Valid combinations are ({1,1,1}, {1,11},{11,1}) = 3 
"11" -> "AA", "K" -> 2 
Valid combinations are ({1,1},{11}) = 2 
"123" -> "ABC", "LC", "AW" -> 3 
Valid combinations are ({1,2,3},{1,23},{12,3}) = 3 

You don't have to return all the mappings, only the number of valid mappings.

Create a class with a collection of integers. 
Enable 3 APIs: 
void append(int x), 
int get(int idx), 
void add_to_all(int x)，//add x to all numbers in collection 
These methods should run in O(1) time. 


Follow-up 
In addition, implement 
void multiply_to_all(int x) 
The same required to run in O(1) time

People enter and leave a room over the course of a day. Each person has a badge with a unique integer id, which is logged by the security system on enter/exit. Each log entry is an enter record (“E <id>”) or and leave record (“L <id>”) for the given badge id. 
The room is empty at the beginning and ending of the day, and there are no other ways into or out of the room. 
E: Enters the room 
L: Leaves the room 

Well formed log: 
E 111 
E 222 
L 111 
E 111 
L 222 
L 111 

Question: You have a log and write a function to check is it the well formed log or not.

In school a student gets rewarded if he has an attendance record without being absent for more than once or being late for 3 times continuously. 
Given a student's attendance record represented by a string with 3 possible characters 'L'(Late), 'A'(Absent), 'O' (On time), 
check whether the student qualifies for the reward. 

e.g. 
@INPUT (String) "OLLAOOOLLO" 
@RETURN (Boolean) False 
The student does not qualify for reward because "LLA" means he was late for 3 times in a row. 

@INPUT (String) "OLLOAOLLO" 
@RETURN (Boolean) True 

Follow-up: 
If known the length of the attendance string is n, how many possible ways there is to attend school and make sure you get the reward.

-----

Given an non-negative int array and target number, check if the target can be equal to the sum of non-negative multiples of the numbers in the array. 
For example, I have three numbers 6,9,20. Ex: n = 47 then it can be determined that 47 = 9*3 + 20 
n=23 then there are no combinations. 
public boolean combinationSum(int[] nums, int target) { 

}

Given a string and an string dictionary, find the longest string in dictionary which can formed by deleting some characters of the giving string. 
eg:S = abpcplea, Dict = {ale, apple, monkey, plea}, the return "apple" 

Find all comments in the Java (it could be Python or any other language of your choice) codes that’s parsed in as a string. 
You may assume the codes given is valid. 

Input is a single string, e.g. 
String codes = 
“/* file created by aonecode.com\\n” + 
“ welcome to the tech blog*/ \\n” + 
“//main method\\n” + 
“public static void main(String[] args) { \\n“ + 
“ System.out.println(“//welcome”); //output\\n” + 
“}” 


Output is a list of strings 

List<String> ret = 
[ 
“ file created by anecode.com\n welcome to the tech blog”, 
“main method”, 
“output” 
]

List all comments in the given segment of codes. It's pretty tricky since there is a lot of things to be considered, especially the escape characters.

Random generate a NxN matrix with only four types of element: 1,2,3,4. 
However, no column or row can have same type of element appears 3 times or above continuously (three same type of elements are connected) 

ex: 

valid: 
1 2 1 1 
3 1 4 2 
1 2 4 2 
3 1 2 3 

invalid because the first column has element 1 appears three times and all 1s are connected to each other : 

1 2 1 3 
1 3 4 2 
1 2 4 4 
2 3 2 2

Card game rule: the hand is drawn from a pack of cards (no jokers). 
Play cards ONLY when they are 
1. 3 of a kind ('AAA' ) or 4 of a kind('AAAA’). 
2. a straight flush of 3 or more cards('JQK' or 'A23456...' in the same suit). 
Find out whether the player is able to play the whole hand given. 
e.g. [Spade A, Spade K, Spade Q, Diamond Q, Heart Q] return false. 
[Spade A, Spade K, Spade Q, Diamond Q, Heart Q, Club Q] return true.

We have a maze with three types of spaces: 
1. Walls 
2. Offices 
3. Hallway space 

Given a maze, determine which non-wall space would minimize the sum of all distances between that space and every office. You can only move up, down, left, and right. 

(Edit: ChrisK described the problem more clearly than I did: "find the field that minimizes the sum of the shortest path[s] from this field to each office space.") 

Example:


WWWWWWWW
WWW O WW
WWW   OW
WWW WWWW
WO  WWWW
WWW WWWW
WO     W
WWWWWWWW
O = office, W = wall, spaces are hallway spaces 

You can represent the maze however you want. That is, you can use any data structures you want, and you don't necessarily have to use O for office, W for Wall, and spaces for hallways.

Give you an unsorted integer iterator 
and a percentage that is expressed in double (for example, 0.4 for 40%), 
and find the number of the sorted array at the percentage position. 
Example: Enter [1 3 2 5 4 6 7 9 8 10], and 0.6, you will return 6 
public int findNumber(Iterator<Integer> nums, double percent){ 
-------
Given a matrix of characters where '_' represents an empty space, 'T' is a tree and 'H' is a house and a coordinate of that matrix, find the sum of the minimum distances from that coordinate to each house when considering that you can move through empty spaces and houses but not through trees.

-------
Given a String and dictionary of words, break the string in minimum space sentence. 
Ex: 
inputStr = "ilikefacebook" 
dictionary = {"i","like","face","book","facebook"} 
Possible Strings: 
i like face book - 3 spaces 
i like Facebook - 2 spaces - this is expected answer.
