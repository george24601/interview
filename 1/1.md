1. [Product of Five](https://csacademy.com/contest/interview-archive/task/product-of-five/)

2. [Previous Permutation](https://csacademy.com/contest/interview-archive/task/previous-permutation/) - Notice the O(1) space requirement, probably have to use c++'s swap()

3. [Power Function](https://csacademy.com/contest/interview-archive/task/power-function/) - Both recursive and iteratively. The judge's answer expects c++'s double precision.

4. [Permutations with Duplicates](https://csacademy.com/contest/interview-archive/task/permutations-with-duplicates/)

5. [Pair Strange Sort](https://csacademy.com/contest/interview-archive/task/pair-strange-sort/) - Note that Python 3 doesn't have cmp for sorted anymore. Probably have to use c++'s custom comparator + operator overloader

6. [Odd Divisors](https://csacademy.com/contest/interview-archive/task/odd_divisors/) - Watch out for Python's implicit the float/int conversion problems
