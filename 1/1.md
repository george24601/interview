4. [Permutations with Duplicates](https://csacademy.com/contest/interview-archive/task/permutations-with-duplicates/) - brute force simulation might not work in O(outputsize). Try some other way

5. [Pair Strange Sort](https://csacademy.com/contest/interview-archive/task/pair-strange-sort/) - tricky/clever solution exists
