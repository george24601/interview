### Why notes on interview ###

1. Everyone hates it, but it is part of the job. Therefore, knowing the rules of the game makes one better interviewer and interviewee, and by extension, better at our jobs. 

2. Knowing "protocols" of interviews will make communiciation between both sides more efficient, i.e., shows respect to everyone's time. It also helps both sides have a correct evaluation of each other

3. Current interview process is an arms race of preparation between candidate. As an interviewer and interviewee, I just have to adapt to such fact.
