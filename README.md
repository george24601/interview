### Why notes on interview ###

1. Everyone hates it, but it is part of the job. Therefore, knowing the rules of the game makes one better interviewer and interviewee, and by extension, better at our jobs. 

2. Knowing "protocols" of interviews will make communiciation between both sides more efficient, i.e., shows respect to everyone's time. It also helps both sides have a correct evaluation of each other

3. Current interview process is an arms race of preparation between candidatew. As an interviewer and interviewee, I just have to adapt to such fact. 

### How to use a problem set ###

1. Format of each problem set: 4 - 6 coding questions, 1 system design question, and some accompanying behaviorial questions 

2. Use each set in a single session to simulate stress and exhaustion you will experience. For example, you can do two sets on a weekend day, and use the night to summarize and reflect 

3. Ideally, find a friend to do mock interview for you. If it is hard to schedule, talk and write against a mirror to simulate the stress of looking at the interviewer.

4. Video/audio recording could help, although the effort might be too much.

5. For language choices, I find python to be the most convenient as I can do with much less typing than C++. Although C++ has its edge if your code needs more complex data structure
