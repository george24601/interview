### Why notes on interview ###

1. Everyone hates it, but it is part of the job. Therefore, knowing the rules of the game makes one better interviewer and interviewee, and by extension, better at our jobs. 

2. Knowing "protocols" of interviews will make communiciation between both sides more efficient, i.e., shows respect to everyone's time

3. The proper interview style of communication should be highly efficient. This is a great way to evaluate candidate's communication skill in a context-less settings. This also means , ideally, our professional communication when there is little shared context should follow the similar pattern. 

4. Knowing rules of the game doesn't mean you can cheat. In fact, human beings are really good at detecting fake emotions, unless you are a great actor. The overall goal is to present yourself in an efficent way. Conversely, an interviewer needs to  understand what tricks the candidate might pull off.

5. Even though I do a lot of coding contest, I find coding interview questions are very different styles. Namely, much less math heavy, but much more emphasis on fast responses, because you are pitted against other candidate's performances.  

### What is covered here ###
1. Mostly my answer to behavioral questions and analysis, because it is not appropriate to share other people's answers

2. For coding questions, mostly Google and Facebook questions from careercup.com, I find their problems most fun to solve. 

3. For system design questions, the detailed answers and analysis are hosted on my blog. Note my answer to such problems change as I learn new tools/techniques
