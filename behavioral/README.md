###Behaviroal Interview######
1. PREPARE for it, by doing mock interviews, or at least record your own answer, and analyze it yourself. I can not stress this enough!

2. The proper interview style of communication should be highly efficient. This is a great way to evaluate candidate's communication skill in a context-less settings. This also means , ideally, our professional communication when there is little shared context should follow the similar pattern. 

4. Knowing rules of the game doesn't mean you can cheat. In fact, human beings are really good at detecting fake emotions, unless you are a great actor. The overall goal is to present yourself in an efficent way. Conversely, an interviewer needs to  understand what tricks the candidate might pull off.
