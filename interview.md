* Overall manager should personally vet the new hires
* Interviewing elsewhere is the most efficient way to see the market average
* Who to hire/promote etc should be done by a commitee with believability weighted decision making
* Better to miss great hire than making a bad hire. Veto rights should be given to multiple people
* First impression is biased and overly important
* Use structured interview questions or sample work, and score on consistant rubics. e.g. Tell me about a time when you [outcome that is needed for this role]. Avoid unstructured if you can - people over-estimate themselves in evaluating other people
* the interview skillset is not equal, ask the best interviewers to make this a bigger part of their job
* have at least two interviewers assess each value or key competency
* Sometimes interviewing gives the highest leverage
* Expert interviewers are often the reason a candidate joins a company
