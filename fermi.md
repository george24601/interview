As long as the initial assumptions in the estimate are reasonable quantities, the result obtained will give an answer within the same scale as the correct result, and if not gives a base for understanding why this is the case.

Fermi estimates are also useful in approaching problems where the optimal choice of calculation method depends on the expected size of the answer

Fermi estimates generally work because the estimations of the individual terms are often close to correct, and overestimates and underestimates help cancel each other out. That is, if there is no consistent bias, a Fermi calculation that involves the multiplication of several estimated factors (such as the number of piano tuners in Chicago) will probably be more accurate than might be first supposed.

In detail, multiplying estimates corresponds to adding their logarithms; thus one obtains a sort of Wiener process or random walk on the logarithmic scale,

However, we are unlikely to have a consistent bias (too high or too low) on a series of unique sub-problems, and thus, our mistakes will tend to balance each other out, as in a random walk. If we are too high in some numbers, we are likely to be too low in other numbers.

This is the same behavior as a random walk (where the average displacement increases as  with time), which we might expect since we hope to guess slightly too high or slightly too low at each number we estimate. Thus, when possible, we should avoid making too many sub-guesses.

Another crucial technique in good estimates is to ignore everything but what you deem to be the most important factor(s) in the problem. 

#How many people in the world are talking on their cell phones in any given minute?

I think that about half the people in the world have cell phones and my guess is that there are about 6 billion people in the world now. That means that 3 billion people have cell phones.
I use my cell phone for a total of about one hour each day. Some people use their phones more than I do and some people use their phones less than I do. That means that I use my phone about 1/24 of the minutes in a day. If I divide the 3 billion people with phones by 24, I should obtain a rough count of the number of people using a phone in any given minute. This means that about 125,000,000 people world wide are using a phone during any given minute.

#How many iPhone screen repairmen are there in the United States?

How many of these are cracked? Phone contracts usually last for two years, and most people take their upgrade, so let's assume that the typical iPhone spends 2.5 years with the customer before being replaced. Now, how many of these screens will be cracked over the lifetime of the phone? I'd guess that this number sits somewhere around 20%.

Every cracked screen doesn't get replaced or else we wouldn't see them around too often. Let's assume that if a crack happens in the first  of the time for which the customer owns the phone, they'll get it fixed, but otherwise they'll just wait for a new phone.

How many repairmen does this support? Let us assume that each iPhone screen takes the average repairmen  to fix and that the average iPhone screen fixer spend about half their full time work week fixing iPhone screens (averaging over full and part time workers).

. Despite the number of cracked iPhone screens being a simpler problem than guessing the number of screen repairmen outright, few people are familiar with the frequency of iPhone screen breaks. We hope this number will be accurate to within a factor of two (we guessed 20% but it could easily be 10% or 30%). Similarly, we took a wild guess at the amount of time required to fix a given iPhone. As it turns out, the true frequency of screen breaks is close to one third of all iPhones and the average repair time is closer to half an hour.
