### How to use a problem set

* Format of each problem set: 4 - 6 coding questions, 1 system design question, and some accompanying behaviorial questions 
* Use each set in a single session to simulate stress and exhaustion you will experience. For example, you can do two sets on a weekend day, and use the night to summarize and reflect 
* Ideally, find a friend to do mock interview for you. If it is hard to schedule, talk and write against a mirror to simulate the stress of looking at the interviewer.
* Video/audio recording could help, although the effort might be too much.
* For language choices, I find python to be the most convenient as I can do with much less typing than C++. Although C++ has its edge if your code needs more complex data structure

### Code Evaluation criteria

* 30% test coverage
* 10% coding style
* 10% documentation/explaination
* Need 75% to pass
