#Coding

1. [Product of Five](https://csacademy.com/contest/interview-archive/task/product-of-five/)

2. [Previous Permutation](https://csacademy.com/contest/interview-archive/task/previous-permutation/) - Notice the O(1) space requirement, probably have to use c++'s swap()

3. [Power Function](https://csacademy.com/contest/interview-archive/task/power-function/) - Both recursive and iteratively. The judge's answer expects c++'s double precision.

4. [Permutations with Duplicates](https://csacademy.com/contest/interview-archive/task/permutations-with-duplicates/)

5. [Pair Strange Sort](https://csacademy.com/contest/interview-archive/task/pair-strange-sort/) - Note that Python 3 doesn't have cmp for sorted anymore. Probably have to use c++'s custom comparator + operator overloader

6. Design and implement a service interface that round robins between 3 IPs, behind it. Need to consider concurrency case

#Behaviorial

1. Tell me about a time when the ability to communicate effectively was critical to the success of a task or project.

2. Describe a situation where initiative on the part of you or someone else was critical.

#System design

Design: account API that deducts money, you can not deduct the user balance into negative. Can not deduct more than once.

Focus: distirbuted transaction and lock, Idempotency
