1. [Min Max Subarray](https://csacademy.com/contest/interview-archive/task/min-max-subarray/)
2. [Least Significant Bit](https://csacademy.com/contest/interview-archive/task/least-significant-bit/)
  * similarly, count how many 1 bits in an integer? how about how many 0 bits in an integer? What if you can use limited storage?
3. [Largest Square](https://csacademy.com/contest/interview-archive/task/largest-square)
4. [Largest Matrix Zone](https://csacademy.com/contest/interview-archive/task/largest-matrix-zone/)
5. [Largest Concat Number](https://csacademy.com/contest/interview-archive/task/largest-concat-number/)
6. Design: use generics to implement LRU.
