### For interviewee
1. STAR stories:
  * Situtation and Task
  * Action YOU TOOK
  * Result: How does it end? what did you/the project accomplish? What did you learn from it
2. Be specific, and avoid generalization. Show what YOU did, not what YOUR TEAM did, or what you WOULD do. Note this is quite different from day-to-day communication, where giving credit to other people and reflecting upon oneself is appreciated
3. Focus on facts and avoid comment/conclusions. Note that is very different from day-to-day communication, where people prefer conclusions to context + facts
4. For each question, prepare THREE different answers.

### For interviewer
* Culture fit evaluations can invite bias into your process if interviewers see it as simply a way to assess a candidate’s likeability, rather than how they align with your company’s core values. Assessing culture fit is about much more than whether or not you’d like to hang out with someone at a company happy hour. Having a structured process and pre-vetted questions can help ensure your team is able to objectively assess culture fit and find the candidates that truly represent your values.
* You want people who will fit in and flourish at your company while, at the same time, challenging the outlook and ideas of your employees.
