### During the conversation

* Be specific, and avoid generalization. Show what YOU did, not what YOUR TEAM did, or what you WOULD do. 
  * Note this is quite different from day-to-day communication, where giving credit to other people and reflecting upon oneself is appreciated. 
  * In fact, look for every opppurtunity to inject specific details
* Focus on facts and avoid comment/conclusions. 
  * If you really need to include comment/conclusions, use the eval from the third party, not yourself.
* For each question, prepare THREE different answers.
