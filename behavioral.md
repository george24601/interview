###Behaviroal Interview######
1. PREPARE for it, by doing mock interviews, or at least record your own answer, and analyze it yourself. I can not stress this enough!

2. The proper interview style of communication should be highly efficient. This is a great way to evaluate candidate's communication skill in a context-less settings. This also means , ideally, our professional communication when there is little shared context should follow the similar pattern. 

3. Knowing rules of the game doesn't mean you can cheat. In fact, human beings are really good at detecting fake emotions, unless you are a great actor. The overall goal is to present yourself in an efficent way. Conversely, an interviewer needs to  understand what tricks the candidate might pull off.

####Things to focus on during practice ####
1. develop STAR stories
STAR:
Situtation and Task:
Action YOU TOOK:
Result: How does it end? what did you/the project accomplish? What did you learn from it

2. be specific, and avoid generalization -> show what YOU did, not what YOUR TEAM did, or what you WOULD do. Note this is quite different from day-to-day communication, where giving credit to other people and reflecting upon oneself is appreciated

3. Focus on facts and avoid comment/conclusions. Note that is very different from day-to-day communication, where people prefer conclusions to context + facts
